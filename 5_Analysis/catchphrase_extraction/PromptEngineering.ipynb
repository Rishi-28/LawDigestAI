The proceeding seeks relief in respect of an unregistered managed investment scheme known as \\\"FullTank\\\" (\\\"the Scheme\\\"). 2 The Scheme was conducted by the second defendant, BTS Management Pty Ltd (\\\"BTS\\\"), under and by reference to the business name \\\"Chargeitcards\\\". The first defendant (\\\"McDougall\\\") is the sole director of BTS. The business name registration records that both BTS and McDougall carry on business under the name Chargeitcards. 3 The evidence establishes that there are no registered managed investment schemes conducted under the names \\\"BTS Management\\\", \\\"Chargeitcards\\\" or \\\"FullTank\\\". Further, neither BTS nor McDougall holds an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of financial services. 4 Merkel J granted interim and interlocutory relief on 18 October and 25 October 2005. The orders made by Merkel J on 25 October 2005 included:\\n \\n (a) injunctive orders pursuant to ss 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (\\\"the Act \\\") restraining the defendants from operating or promoting the Scheme; \\n (b) orders pursuant to s 1101B(4)(b)(i) of the Act suspending all internet websites within the power or control of the defendants promoting, advertising or offering the Scheme; and\\n (c) orders pursuant to ss 601EE and 1323 of the Act appointing receivers of all the property of BTS and directing the receivers to investigate and report on the Scheme. The receivers subsequently filed a report with the Court on 22 November 2005 detailing the results of their investigation of the Scheme. 5 ASIC now seeks final relief as follows:\\n \\n \\\" THE COURT DECLARES THAT: \\n \\n On the basis of the evidence contained in the affidavits and their respective exhibits filed by the Plaintiff: \\n \\n \\n 1. From September 2005 until October 2005 the Defendants contravened section 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 by operating an unregistered managed investment scheme defined in the Schedule to the Order ('the Scheme') which required registration as a managed investment scheme but was not so registered. 2. From September 2005 until October 2005 the Defendants contravened section 911A of the Corporations Act 2001 by carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction, by offering interests in the Scheme, without holding an Australian financial services licence. THE COURT ORDERS BY WAY OF FINAL RELIEF THAT: \\n \\n \\n 3. Pursuant to section 1324(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 the Defendants be and hereby are permanently restrained whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise from further operating or promoting the Scheme. 4. Pursuant to sections 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Corporations Act 2001 the Defendants be and hereby are permanently restrained whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise from carrying on business in relation to financial products or financial services by: \\n (a) providing financial product advice in respect of the Scheme by recommending it, stating an opinion in respect of it or reporting either of those things; \\n (b) dealing in financial products by issuing, granting or making available the Scheme or participation in it; \\n without holding an Australian financial services licence. 5. Pursuant to sections 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Corporations Act 2001 the Defendants be and hereby are permanently restrained whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise from: \\n (a) carrying on any business related to, concerning or directed to be a managed investment scheme within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 ; \\n (b) being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or a party to the promotion or establishment of, or the carrying on of the business of, a managed investment scheme within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001 , \\n that requires, in any case, registration under section 601ED of the Corporations Act 2001 and has not been so registered. 6. The Scheme be wound up pursuant to section 601EE(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 . 7. Pursuant to section 601EE(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart be appointed joint and several liquidators of the Scheme ('the Liquidators'). 8. The Liquidators have power to do, in Australia and elsewhere, all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the winding up of the Scheme, or incidental to the attainment of the winding up of the Scheme including the powers identified in section 477 of the Corporations Act 2001 as if each reference there to a 'company' was a reference to the Scheme. 9. The reasonable costs and expenses of the Receivers and winding up the Scheme including the professional costs and expenses of the Liquidators shall be paid out of the assets of the Scheme. 10. Within 7 days of the making of this Order the Defendants pay to the Liquidators the sum of $80,000.00, such sum to be applied by the Liquidators (together with the Scheme's assets) in accordance with section 556 of the Corporations Act 2001 as if each reference there to a 'company' was a reference to the Scheme. 11. The Liquidators must, within 21 days of completing the winding up of the Scheme, provide to the Court and the parties (verified in writing) a: \\n (a) report detailing the actions taken by the Liquidators in the winding up of the Scheme and; \\n (b) report detailing all receipts and payments made in the winding up and in complying with these Orders and the Orders made in this proceeding on 25 October 2005. 12. To the extent that the sum paid to the Liquidators under Order 10 is not sufficient (together with the Scheme's cash assets) to discharge all the liabilities of the Scheme, as determined by the Liquidators, together with the remuneration, costs, fees and expenses of the Liquidators then the Defendants shall pay such shortfall to the Liquidators within 21 days of receiving a call for payment of such shortfall from the Liquidators. 13. The Defendants pay the Plaintiff's costs of the proceeding. 14. The proceeding otherwise be dismissed without adjudication. \\\" \\n \\n \\n\\nThe defendants, BTS and McDougall consent to the orders in paragraphs 3 to 14 above. They do not oppose the making of the declarations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. OUTLINE OF THE FULLTANK SCHEME \\n \\n6 The Scheme was marketed by the defendants as a fuel club which allowed members to purchase fuel at a substantial discount. This was to be achieved by issuing a debit card to each member investing in the Scheme. The debit card could be used to purchase fuel and other goods at fuel retailers through the EFTPOS system. The defendants promised a substantial discount on the cost of fuel, which varied from 80 per cent in September 2005 down to 50 per cent in October 2005. 7 The defendants launched the Scheme and began accepting membership applications on 12 September 2005. The Scheme became operational on 10 October 2005 when the first amounts were uploaded to debit cards issued to the investing members. The debit cards in question were stored value debit cards issued by EMerchants Holdings Pty Ltd.\\n \\n8 As at 25 October 2005, the Scheme had 134 investors. Of those investors, approximately 107 had paid their full subscription. By 25 October 2005, total funds invested in the Scheme amounted to $93,193.30. The remaining cash balance of the Scheme as at 25 October 2005 was $33,150.22. THE FULLTANK WEBSITE \\n \\n9 The Scheme was marketed by means of a website. The address of the website was http://chargeitcards.com/fulltank . The website represented to the general public that FullTank members could make very substantial savings on their fuel bill over a 20 week period by subscribing to one of FullTank's fuel plans. For a short time, the Scheme offered benefits over a 52 week period, but this was soon shortened to 20 weeks. The available fuel plans were:\\n \\n \\n Plan \\n \\n Membership \\n Fee ($) \\n \\n Plan \\n Fee ($) \\n \\n \\n Scheme Benefit \\n \\n FT 25 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 250 \\n \\n $25 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n FT 50 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 500 \\n \\n $50 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n FT 75 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 750 \\n \\n $75 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n FT 100 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 1000 \\n \\n $100 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n FT 150 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 1500 \\n \\n $150 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n FT 200 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 2000 \\n \\n $200 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n FT 300 \\n \\n 140 \\n \\n 3000 \\n \\n $300 petrol per week for 20 weeks \\n \\n \\n\\nPotential investors could select a fuel plan from these options. As the table makes clear, the numeric component of the fuel plan description refers to the dollar amount which would be credited to an investor's debit card each week for the period of the plan. 10 As it stood on 12 October 2005, the FullTank website made the following representations:\\n \\n \\\"Never pay full price for fuel again. FullTank offers the worlds first and only fuel club that allows members to save 50% on all their fuel costs. Members are supplied with an easy to use FullTank Debit Card that is loaded each week with their nominated weekly fuel requirement. FullTank Cards can be used at all correctly coded (EFTPOS) fuel outlets across Australia, even if they have never heard of FullTank ! Only 5000 FullTank Cards available!

As at 20 September 2005, the website claimed that members would save up to 80 per cent on all their fuel costs by subscribing to FullTank. 11 The website explicitly withholds any information about how members' funds would be invested and how the fuel savings would be achieved. THE USE OF SUBSCRIPTION MONIES \\n \\n12 McDougall was examined by ASIC on 11 October 2005. In the course of his examination, he said that the defendants intended to invest money provided by subscribers to the Scheme in various high yield investments. In fact, the only investment made by the defendants was an investment in a foreign exchange trading account with Forex Capital Markets LLC (\\\"Forex\\\"). Forex is based in New York, USA, and provides an online internet currency trading facility. 13 McDougall apparently believed that he could make sufficient profits from online foreign exchange trading to fund the Scheme's obligations to its investors. In the course of his examination, he said he expected returns of approximately 30 per cent per month with minimal risk of loss as a result of foreign exchange trading. This implies a return of 360 per cent per annum. In fact, the evidence is that in the first two weeks of online currency trading, the defendants incurred a loss of $2649.87. 14 Foreign exchange trading involves a high level of risk. Some of these risks are referred to on the website maintained by Forex. During the course of his examination by ASIC, McDougall said that he did not have any experience in the foreign currency market. He also conceded that investors in the Scheme were totally unaware that their funds were being used to invest in foreign exchange trading. 15 It is clear that, unless McDougall and BTS made extraordinary profits from currency trading, the only way that the Scheme's obligations to its investors could be met would be through the use of membership fees paid by new investors. A Scheme which operates in this manner is commonly described as a \\\"Ponzi\\\" scheme. ASIC's consumer protection website has described a Ponzi scheme in the following terms:\\n \\n \\\"In these schemes the promoter promises investors a very high return on their investment and says it is secure. Part of the money deposited by early investors is then used to pay their first dividend cheques or interest. So long as the money keeps flowing into the scheme, payments can still come out. However, the burden of future payments also keeps growing. The scheme inevitably collapses once people stop joining. \\\" \\n \\n\\n16 BTS did not maintain accurate books and records of the transactions conducted under the Scheme. In their report to the Court, the receivers constructed a summary of cash receipts and payments into and out of the Scheme for the period from 12 September 2005 to 25 October 2005, and a table of the Scheme's available assets as at 25 October 2005. Of the $93,193 invested in the Scheme by investors, $30,000 was paid into a foreign currency trading account with Forex. After accumulated trading losses of $2649 and certain fees charged by Forex, the available balance of $27,303 was recovered from Forex by the receivers. The invested funds were also used to make various private payments on behalf of McDougall and BTS. For instance, McDougall caused $5044 to be paid to a company which provides horse racing software; a laptop computer was purchased for the private use of McDougall's sister at a cost of $1297; motor vehicle expenses of $2000 were paid in respect of McDougall's personal motor vehicles; school fees of $1000 were paid to the school attended by McDougall's children; and $4000 was paid into McDougall's personal Totaliser Agency Board account. BTS also issued five fuel cards to members of McDougall's family despite the fact that they had not paid any membership fees. Using the funds invested in the Scheme by other members, each of these cards was subsequently credited with $1000. THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE SCHEME \\n \\n17 After investigating the financial position of the Scheme, the receivers reported to the Court that the Scheme had an estimated deficiency before receivers' costs of $41,162. Receivers' costs payable out of the assets under receivership are in the order of $40,000. In large measure, the deficiency in the Scheme is attributable to the fact that total liabilities outstanding to members are $83,370, whereas the total assets available to the Scheme are only $49,423. 18 The receivers concluded that if the Scheme were allowed to continue operating with the limited cash assets available to it, those assets would be dissipated in approximately 5 weeks. In their opinion, the Scheme was fundamentally flawed, particularly given that the implicit rate of return required to refund the outstanding payments to investors was completely unachievable. They recommended that the Scheme not be allowed to continue to operate. THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF BTS \\n \\n19 The receivers also investigated the financial position of BTS. Their evidence was that BTS had an estimated deficiency of liabilities over assets of $118,561. CONDUCT FOLLOWING THE COURT'S INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS \\n \\n20 After the Court made interlocutory orders on 25 October 2005, investors in the Scheme received an email from Mr Rob McMillan (\\\"McMillan\\\") on the subject of \\\"FullTank Resolution Options\\\". McMillan is a member of the Scheme and an associate of McDougall. 21 The email to FullTank investors stated, inter alia :\\n \\n \\\"By now you will have received a letter from Ferrier Hodgson (appointed receivers by ASIC) outlining ASIC's determination to close down Chargeitcards' FullTank program. Having read previous emails and perhaps speaking with you over the phone this may come as no surprise to you. As a result a new structure has formed an alliance with a large membership organisation that plans to take the new program both nationally &amp; internationally. But before this can happen, FullTank is required by ASIC to fully dissolve the original membership, resulting in the closure of the original program. Most of you have indicated your willingness to continue your involvement in a fuel program &amp; it is FullTank's intention to honour their obligations however one of two things must happen before they can proceed with the new fuel program:...\\\" \\n \\n\\nThe email went on to state that two options were available to investors: either they could elect to receive a reimbursement from the receivers, or they could elect to cease involvement in the original Scheme and to continue membership under a new structure. The second option required investors to return a letter to BTS which stated that the investor wished to forgive BTS of any debt owed to the investor concerning the FullTank program. 22 McDougall told the receivers that he had caused the email to be sent out because he did not want any of the investors in the FullTank Scheme to lose money. McDougall also said that he realised that the email may be a breach of the Court's interlocutory orders of 25 October 2005. 23 There is also evidence before me, which I accept, that members of the Scheme received telephone calls from an unknown person who said he was a fellow member who was making the call on behalf of McDougall. The caller told members that there would be new cards issued and not to be discouraged as the Scheme would reopen. 24 McDougall received a large number of letters from investors in the Scheme in response to the email by which those investors agreed to forgive any debts owed to them by BTS in relation to the FullTank program. 25 The evidence also shows that on 17 October 2005 BTS purported to assign the business name \\\"Chargeitcards\\\", the domain name www.chargeitcards.com , and the product name \\\"FullTank\\\" to Mr Timothy McDougall, who is McDougall's son. 26 Understandably, ASIC pointed to this material as indicating that there was a substantial risk that the defendants would repeat their contraventions of the Act , unless they were restrained from engaging in similar conduct in the future. FULLTANK WAS AN UNREGISTERED MANAGED INVESTMENT SCHEME \\n \\n27 Relevantly, s 9 of the Act defines a managed investment scheme as a scheme that has the following features:\\n \\n \\\"(i) people contribute money or money's worth as consideration to acquire rights (interests) to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the rights are actual, prospective or contingent and whether they are enforceable or not); \\n (ii) any of the contributions are to be pooled, or used in a common enterprise, to produce financial benefits, or benefits consisting of rights or interests in property, for the people (the members) who hold interests in the scheme (whether as contributors to the scheme or as people who have acquired interests from holders); \\n (iii) the members do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions)\\\". Section 9 excludes various entities, funds or schemes from the scope of this definition, but none of those exclusions is applicable in this case. 28 Section 601ED(1) provides, inter alia , that a managed investment scheme must be registered under s 601EB if it has more than 20 members. Neither the exemption in subs (2) nor subs (3) of s 601ED is applicable in this case. 29 Section 601ED(5) provides that a person must not operate in this jurisdiction a managed investment scheme that is required to be registered under s 601EB unless the scheme is so registered. 30 Section 601EE(1) provides that if a person operates a managed investment scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) , ASIC may apply to the Court to have the scheme wound up. The Court may make any orders that it considers appropriate for the winding up of the scheme in the event that ASIC makes an application of the kind described in s 601EE(1). 31 On the evidence, the Scheme was a managed investment scheme that required registration, and it was not registered. By 25 October 2005, the Scheme had 134 members. It had approximately 127 members as at 17 October 2005. 32 Investors in the Scheme paid to receive a FullTank debit card and the rights and benefits which came with it. Their subscription monies were pooled in bank accounts held by BTS which were invested by BTS at McDougall's direction. The object was to produce financial returns which were promoted on the website as a saving on fuel costs. 33 The members of the Scheme had no control over its day to day operation. They had no knowledge that the pooled funds were being partly transferred to a foreign exchange trading account with Forex. Nor did they know that subscription monies were being used by McDougall to pay some of his own personal expenses or those of his family and associates. 34 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 (\\\" Pegasus \\\"), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme. His Honour said at [55]-[57]:\\n \\n \\\"The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance. The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme. The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: \\n \\n 5. To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work. 6. To cause or actuate the working of; to work (a machine, etc). Chiefly U.S. \\n 7. To direct the working of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a principle, an undertaking, etc) orig. U.S. \\n \\n \\n I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme. He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations. He supervised others in their performance. I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6). He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus. He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme. \\\" \\n \\n\\n35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 36 There is no doubt that McDougall was the person who formulated and directed the Scheme, and he was the directing mind and will of BTS in its day to day operations in relation to the Scheme. Accordingly, I find that both McDougall and BTS operated the Scheme. 37 After these proceedings were commenced and after Merkel J had made interlocutory orders on 25 October 2005, McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in a different form. He procured McMillan to solicit members to forgive existing Scheme debts on the promise of equivalent interests in a new scheme. 38 The defendants were represented at the hearing of this proceeding by Mr Erlich of counsel. On their behalf, he submitted that the evidence before the Court was capable of establishing all of the elements necessary to establish that BTS and McDougall contravened s 601ED(5). I am satisfied that this is so. Mr Erlich did not consent to the making of declarations of contravention, but he did not oppose that course. THE DEFENDANTS CARRIED ON AN UNLICENSED FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS \\n \\n39 Section 911A provides that a person who carries on a financial services business in this jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial services. In my opinion, both defendants contravened this provision. They carried on a financial services business without holding an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial services under the Scheme. 40 Section 761A provides that a financial service business is a business of providing financial services. In my opinion, BTS was providing a financial service when it promoted, offered and issued memberships in the Scheme\\n \\n41 To explain this conclusion, it is necessary to trace through the statutory concepts of \\\"financial investment\\\", \\\"financial product\\\" and \\\"financial services\\\". 42 Section 763B provides that:\\n \\n \\\"For the purposes of this Chapter, a person (the investor) makes a financial investment if: \\n \\n (a) the investor gives money or money's worth (the contribution) to another person and any of the following apply: \\n (i) the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor; \\n (ii) the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); \\n (iii) the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return, or other benefit, for the investor (even if no return or benefit is in fact generated); and \\n (b) the investor has no day-to-day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit. \\\" \\n \\n \\n\\n43 Investors in the Scheme paid money to BTS who used it to generate a financial return or benefit for the member by providing a return that was applied to generate the fuel discount or saving. Investors intended that BTS would use their contributions to generate a financial return in the form of fuel discounts or savings. The members had no day-to-day control over the use of their contributions to the Scheme. It does not matter that the Scheme failed to generate returns or benefits of the kind, or to the extent, represented. It follows that, by investing in the Scheme, members made a financial investment within the meaning of s 763B. 44 Section 763A(1) provides that a financial product includes a facility through which, or through the acquisition of which, a person makes a financial investment. The FullTank Scheme satisfies this description; it offers or represents a facility through which investors make a financial investment. The Scheme is therefore a financial product within the meaning of s 763A(1). 45 The Scheme also constitutes a financial product within the meaning of s 764A(1)(ba). Under this provision an interest in a managed investment scheme that is not a registered scheme, but which is required to be registered by s 601ED(1) , constitutes a financial product for the purposes of ch 7 of the Act . 46 Section 761E(4) provides: \\n \\n \\\"Subject to this section, the issuer, in relation to a financial product issued to a person (the client), is the person responsible for the obligations owed, under the terms of the facility that is the product: \\n \\n (a) to, or to a person nominated by, the client; or \\n (b) if the product has been transferred from the client to another person and is now held by that person or another person to whom it has subsequently been transferred--to, or to a person nominated by, that person or that other person. \\\" \\n \\n\\n47 In this case, it is plain that BTS qualifies as an issuer of the financial product constituted by the Scheme or interests in it. BTS is a person responsible for the obligations owed under the Scheme. The website states that Chargeitcards is owned and operated by BTS and that Chargeitcards guarantees that if for any reason it was not able to maintain the weekly payments, then every member affected would receive a pro-rata refund of the first 10 weeks membership less any payment made to the members' card account. By promoting, offering and managing the Scheme, BTS was dealing in a financial product for the purposes of s 766C(1) of the Act . 48 Section 766A(1)(b) provides that a person provides a financial service if they deal in a financial product. Accordingly, by dealing in a financial product BTS was also providing a financial service for the purposes of ch 7. 49 For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that BTS was carrying on a financial services business. It required a licence to do so. As BTS did not hold a licence, it contravened s 911A(1). 50 I consider that McDougall, as the sole director and controller of BTS and as one of the registered owners of the business name Chargeitcards, was also carrying on an unlicensed financial services business in contravention of s 911A(1). Further and in any event, McDougall was acting as a representative of BTS in offering and promoting memberships in the Scheme. As such, McDougall was only exempt from the requirement that he hold an Australian financial services licence if BTS itself held such a licence, and it did not. 51 Numerous cases have held that s 911A of the Act extends to a company director who conducts or is involved in a company's carrying on of a financial services business without an Australian financial services licence: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Giann &amp; Giann Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 81 ; (2005) 141 FCR 278; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Manito Pty Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 56; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Drury Management Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 68. 52 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that BTS and McDougall each contravened the provisions of s 911A by carrying on a financial services business without holding an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of financial services under or in connection with the Scheme. DECLARATORY RELIEF \\n \\n53 ASIC has sought declarations that the defendants contravened s 601ED(5) and s 911A of the Act . It is very clear that this Court has power pursuant to ss 21 , 22 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to make the declarations that have been sought. 54 In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564, at 581-582, Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief. Their Honours added that it is a discretionary power which it is neither possible nor desirable to fetter by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise, although it must be recognised that it is a power confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power. In the same case, Brennan J emphasised that the making of a declaration, and the terms in which it is to be made, are in the court's discretion: at 596. 55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110. 56 The contraventions in this case were extremely serious. It is an understatement to say that the Scheme involved extremely high risks. The website promoting the Scheme misrepresented the nature of the investment and withheld vital information from investors. The nature and extent of the risks attending the Scheme were not disclosed in any way to investors. No proper books and records were kept concerning the Scheme. Moreover, the Scheme's assets were dissipated, in part, on the personal expenses of McDougall and his family. 57 McDougall also attempted to revive the Scheme in another form. In doing so, he was prepared to act in breach of the interlocutory orders made by Merkel J. There is a clear public interest in making declarations that will record the contraventions of the Act , and express the Court's strong disapproval of the contravening conduct. 58 The defendants do not oppose the making of declaratory orders in the form sought by ASIC, although they stop short of consenting to them. In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the grant of declaratory relief in the form sought by ASIC. With one minor adjustment, I am satisfied that the terms of the declarations are clear and precise. The adjustment I have made is simply a revision of the definition of the Scheme set out in the schedule to the orders. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \\n \\n59 ASIC seeks injunctive orders restraining the defendants from further operating or promoting the Scheme, and from further dealing in financial products in connection with the Scheme. These orders are sought pursuant to ss 1101B and 1324 (1) of the Act . In my opinion, these orders are entirely appropriate. 60 In addition, ASIC seeks injunctive orders in the somewhat wider form set out in par 5 of the draft orders: see par 5 above. This form of order extends beyond the conduct of the Scheme. In effect, it seeks to restrain the defendants from promoting, establishing or carrying on the business of any managed investment scheme that requires registration but which has not been registered. 61 Although the defendants have consented to injunctive orders in this wider form, I propose to address the question whether ss 1101B and 1324 (1) authorise the making of injunctive orders in this wider form. Section 1101B(1) provides:\\n \\n \\n \\\"(1) The Court may make such order, or orders, as it thinks fit if: \\n \\n \\n (a) on the application of ASIC, it appears to the Court that a person: \\n (i) has contravened a provision of this Chapter, or any other law relating to dealing in financial products or providing financial services; or \\n (ii) ... \\n \\n \\n \\n ... \\n \\n However, the Court can only make such an order if the Court is satisfied that the order would not unfairly prejudice any person. \\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n62 Section 1101B(4) is also relevant. It provides, inter alia :\\n \\n \\\"(4) Without limiting subsection (1), some examples of orders the Court may make under subsection (1) include: \\n (a) an order restraining a person from carrying on a business, or doing an act or classes of acts, in relation to financial products or financial services, if the person has persistently contravened, or is continuing to contravene: \\n (i) a provision or provisions of this Chapter; or \\n (ii) a provision or provisions of any other law relating to dealing in financial products or providing financial services; or \\n ... \\n \\n ... \\n \\n (f) an order restraining a person from providing any financial services that are specified in the order; and \\n \\n ... \\n \\n \\n \\n (j) any ancillary order considered to be just and reasonable in consequence of the making of an order under any of the preceding provisions of this subsection. \\\" \\n \\n \\n\\nIt is significant that the orders may extend to orders restraining a person from doing a class of acts in relation to financial products or services if the person has persistently contravened a provision of the Chapter. 63 Section 1324(1) is also expressed in wide terms:\\n \\n \\n \\\"(1) Where a person has engaged, is engaging or is proposing to engage in conduct that constituted, constitutes or would constitute: \\n \\n \\n (a) a contravention of this Act ; or \\n (b) attempting to contravene this Act ; or \\n (c) aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a person to contravene this Act ; or \\n (d) inducing or attempting to induce, whether by threats, promises or otherwise, a person to contravene this Act ; or \\n (e) being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of this Act ; or \\n (f) conspiring with others to contravene this Act ; \\n \\n the Court may, on the application of ASIC, or of a person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the conduct, grant an injunction, on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, restraining the first-mentioned person from engaging in the conduct and, if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, requiring that person to do any act or thing. \\\" \\n \\n\\n64 Section 1324 permits the Court to grant an injunction \\\"on such terms as the court thinks appropriate\\\". These words echo the concluding words of s 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (\\\"TPA\\\") which state that the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate. These words were introduced into s 80(1) by a 1983 amendment to the TPA, which, to adapt the language used by French J in OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500 at 508, freed the power conferred by s 80 from the previous constraint that the injunction granted under it must restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of Part IV of Part V of the TPA or one of the species of accessorial participation there listed. 65 The operation of s 80(1) of the TPA was canvassed by the Full Court of this Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 (\\\" ICI \\\"). Lockhart J described s 80(1) as a public interest provision which attracts special considerations; it represents a primary means of ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation: at 254-255. After referring to subss 80(4) and (5), Lockhart J said: \\n \\n \\\"Injunctions are traditionally employed to restrain repetition of conduct. A statutory provision that enables an injunction to be granted to prevent the commission of conduct that has never been done before and is not likely to be done again is a statutory enlargement of traditional equitable principles. But this is because traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights. Public interest injunctions are different. Parts IV and V of the Act involve matters of high public policy. Parts IV and V relate to practices and conduct that legislatures throughout the world in different forms and to different degrees, have decided are contrary to the public interest (contracts, arrangements or understandings affecting competition adversely (s 45)), the misuse of market power (s 46) , the practice of exclusive dealing (s 47) , resale price maintenance (s 48) , price discrimination (s 49) , anti-competitive mergers (s 50) and unfair practices with respect to consumers (Pt V). These are legislative enactments of matters vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society. \\\" \\n \\n\\nIn his Honour's view, the section would in an appropriate case authorise the Court to grant an injunction against a respondent preventing him in engaging in conduct which is similar to the conduct which constituted, or would constitute, a contravention of the Act : at 261. Lockhart J also agreed (at 261) with the reasoning of Barwick CJ in Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 632 that in an appropriate case the court may grant an injunction to restrain the respondent from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance notwithstanding that only some of the acts falling within s 96(3) were found to have been so committed. 66 Gummow J said at 267:\\n \\n \\\" Section 80(1) confers upon the court the power to grant an injunction where it is satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute conduct of the description in pars (a)-(f). The power of the court to grant an injunction is controlled by the words 'in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate'. Thus, the terms of the injunction will not be 'appropriate' if, on its face, it operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act . The injunction should not prohibit conduct falling outside the boundaries drawn by s 80: see Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161. The same limitation applies to mandatory injunctive relief. It is, in my view, no support for the grant of an injunction which, from the outset, has an operation outside the boundaries of s 80 , to say that it is open for the party enjoined to apply under s 80(3) to vary the injunction so as to bring its operation wholly within proper limits. The party in question should not be placed under any such obligation in the first place. \\\" \\n \\n\\nThe statement that the terms of an injunction will not be appropriate if it \\\"operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act \\\" is somewhat ambiguous. However, at first blush at least, it suggests a narrower approach to s 80 than that described by Lockhart J. 67 French J said that s 80 was a widely drawn remedial provision which was available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon the public interest by contravening the provisions of the TPA in Part IV and Part V. His Honour added at 268:\\n \\n \\\"There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court. The possibility remains open, by virtue of s 80(3) , that after a suitable period unmarked by further contravention the party restrained may apply to the court to rescind the order. The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act . This was a proper case for the grant of that relief. \\\" \\n \\n\\n68 In ACCC v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197 at 202 at [D]-[E], after referring to these passages in ICI , Merkel J said:\\n \\n \\\"The width of the power conferred by s 80 and its public interest character obviously give the Court great amplitude in determining appropriate injunctive orders in a particular case. However there are limitations on the Court's power under the section. Confinement of the power by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA, and in particular s 80 , is one limitation on the power. However, there are at least two further limitations. The power to make orders under s 80 is only enlivened in a proceeding which alleges that there has been a contravention of a provision of Pt IV , IVA or V of the TPA. As was said by Gummow J in ICI at 267, the terms of an injunction granted under s 80 must, on their face, operate upon a range of conduct which has 'the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act . Irrespective of whether the injunction is sought or granted under s 80(1) or 80 (1AA) there must be a nexus between the conduct alleged or found to constitute the relevant contraventions and the injunctions granted. \\\" \\n \\n\\n69 It is implicit in Merkel J's judgment that an injunction under s 80 may extend beyond the specific conduct proven to constitute a contravention by s 80 and may, in appropriate cases, extend to conduct of the same kind or class. There must, however, be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the conduct that is the subject of the restraint and the conduct that was alleged to constitute a contravention of the Act . As French J pointed out in ACCC v Real Estate Institute (WA) [1999] FCA 1387 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 131, the question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the orders sought and the contraventions alleged involves an evaluative judgment by the Court which will depend heavily upon the circumstances of the particular case. 70 Most recently, in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 , a Full Court (comprising Ryan, Finn and Allsop JJ) noted the apparent tension between the view expressed by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in ICI . Their Honours said at [30]-[31]:\\n \\n \\\"His Honour's reference to terms having 'an operation outside the boundaries of s 80 ' is no more than a paraphrase of the actual words of the subsection 'such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate. ' That paraphrase, we consider with respect, does not illuminate the amplitude which should be given, as a matter of construction, to the grant of power. In our view, a more helpful guide to resolving the question of construction is afforded by this observation, also from ICI v Trade Practices Commission , of Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) at 256; \\n \\n \\n 'In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pt IV or V of the Act ), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly. ' \\n \\n \\n \\n This approach of Lochkhart J accords with the view often expressed by the High Court that discretions or powers entrusted to Courts should be read liberally for the relevant statutory purpose, without making implications or imposing limitations not found in the express words: Australian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270 at [77] and see generally for the cases Hewlett Packard v GE Capital [2003] FCAFC 256 ; (2003) 203 ALR 51 at [187] . \\\" \\n \\n\\nThus, the Full Court preferred the wider view described by Lockhart and French JJ in ICI to the narrower view which the appellant in Foster sought to found upon the judgment of Gummow J. 71 The issue in Foster was whether an injunction that restrained the fourth respondent from being directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct of a business of a specified kind for a period of five years went beyond the power conferred by s 80 of the TPA. As the Full Court explained, this turned on the existence of a sufficient nexus between a contravention that enlivened the Court's power under s 80 and the conduct that was restrained by the injunction:\\n \\n \\\"In our view, the need, suggested by the authorities, for a nexus between the contravention of the Act which the Court has found and the terms of the restraint which it then decides to impose is a specific reflection of Lockhart J's insistence that the power be exercised 'judicially and sensibly'. It goes to the appropriateness of the relief contemplated by the concluding words of s 80(1) , not to the extent of the power to grant it. If the Court considers that a complete prohibition, whether permanently or for a specified period, on a respondent's engaging in a particular field of commercial activity or industry is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention, s 80 is wide enough to support such a prohibition as a matter of power. This analysis of s 80 conforms, we consider, with that recently undertaken by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482 at 504 [110]. \\\" \\n \\n\\nThe Full Court held that there was an appropriate nexus, as the evidence and the trial judge's findings at first instance gave rise to a real fear that the fourth respondent would, unless restrained, commit further conduct of the same general kind. In these circumstances, it was appropriate to cast the injunction more widely in order to catch conduct which was similar to the established contravention: at [34] and [38]. 72 In the present case, I consider that the wider form of injunctive relief is appropriate, especially given the evidence that McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in another form. The evidence demonstrates, in my view, that the defendants are susceptible to repeating their contraventions of the managed investment provisions of the Act . There is, in my opinion, a sufficient nexus between the wider form of injunctive order sought by ASIC in par 5 of the draft orders, and the contraventions of the Act which were established by the evidence in this case. The wider form of injunction is consented to by the defendants. In all the circumstances, I consider that the wider form of injunction is warranted, and that it will serve the public interest. WINDING UP THE SCHEME \\n \\n73 ASIC seeks orders that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601EE(1) of the Act . A number of ancillary orders are sought, including an order appointing the existing Court appointed receivers as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme. The defendants consent to these orders being made. I have made two minor alterations to the form of the draft orders for the winding up of the Scheme. The first alteration, in par 7, identifies Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart as the receivers appointed by order of Merkel J on 25 October 2005. The second alteration clarifies that the receivers referred to in par 9 are the individuals identified in the above par 7 of the orders. 74 In ASIC v Takaran Pty Ltd (No 2) (2003) 194 ALR 743 at 747-748, at [15], Barrett J made the following observation, with which I agree:\\n \\n \\\"The fact that a scheme is being operated by its existing operators in contravention of statute activates a public interest in favour of not only its being wound up under s 601EE ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488) but also 'ensuring the transparency of the winding up process and the safeguarding of the rights of the contributories' by committing the winding up to an independent party ( Bells Securities Pty Ltd v LPG Mourant [2002] QSC 156 ; BC200202989 per Wilson J; see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Product Management Group Pty Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 343). \\\" \\n \\n\\n75 In this case, it makes eminent good sense that the existing Court appointed receivers be appointed as the joint and several liquidators of the Scheme. 76 The defendants have also consented to orders which are designed to ensure that the liquidation does not result in any shortfall to investors in the Scheme. Specifically, the defendants have consented to orders that they will pay to the liquidators the sum of $80,000.00 to be applied by the liquidators in accordance with s 556 of the Act as if references to the company were a reference to the Scheme. To guard against the risk that the sum of $80,000.00 is not sufficient to ensure that there is no shortfall in discharging all of the liabilities of the Scheme, the defendants have consented to a further order that they will pay any such shortfall to the liquidators within 21 days of receiving a call for payment. 77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent. In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] --- [98]. Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling. 78 In the present case, I must bear in mind that the defendants have been prepared to consent to orders that will ensure that there is no shortfall in the winding up of the Scheme. I also recognise that the solvency of BTS depends, ultimately, on the availability of support from McDougall. In these circumstances, and given that ASIC has not sought a winding up order in respect of BTS, I have concluded that there it is not necessary to make a winding up order in respect of BTS. This is not a case in which ASIC has suggested that the recovery for investors will be maximised by ordering a winding up of both the Scheme and the company which administered the Scheme. THE RECEIVER'S COSTS \\n \\n79 On 6 December 2005, I made an order by consent that the costs and expenses of the receivers were determined to be $30,831.00 and that this sum be paid to them from the funds received by them in the course of the receivership. The receivers have filed an affidavit which indicates that this figure was mistakenly calculated in that it did not make full allowance for all of the outstanding costs and expenses of the receivers at that time. Further receivership costs have been incurred since 6 December 2005. 80 The receivers' costs are addressed in par 9 of the orders I propose to make. Paragraph 9 provides that the reasonable costs and expenses of the receivers (referred to in par 7) and of the winding up of the Scheme, including the professional costs and expenses of the liquidators, shall be paid out of the assets of the Scheme. Paragraph 7 of the orders identifies the receivers as Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart and appoints them as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme. I am satisfied that this form of order is appropriate. COSTS \\n \\n81 The defendants have consented to an order that they pay ASIC's costs of the proceedings, and I will so order. I certify that the preceding eighty-one (81) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young J. Associate:\\n\\nDated: 20 April 2006\\n\\n\\n Counsel for the Applicant: M R Scott \\n \\n Solicitor for the Applicant: Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission \\n \\n Counsel for the Respondents: P Ehrlich \\n \\n Solicitor for the Respondents: Schetzer Brott &amp; Appel \\n \\n Solicitor for the Receivors: N Fryde \\n \\n Counsel for the Receivors: Dibbs Abbott Stillman \\n \\n Date of Hearing: 3 April 2006 \\n \\n Date of Judgment: 20 April 2006 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \\n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/427.html\",\n          \"INTRODUCTION \\n The applicant seeks review of the respondent's decision under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (ADJR Act). The decision in question is that of the respondent, an employee of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The applicant has issued four other sets of proceedings against individual officers of the ATO. The events with which each proceeding is concerned are related. The reasoning on determination of each proceeding is also similar. The respondent objects to the competency of the application on the basis that the decision the subject of the application was a decision making or forming part of the process of making assessments under the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (GST Act) and is excluded by Sch 1 of the ADJR Act. GROUNDS OF REVIEW \\n The grounds upon which the applicant seeks review are numerous and reflect those appearing under s 5 of the ADJR Act. They are as follows: \\n (a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision;\\n (b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed;\\n (c) that the decision was not authorized by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made;\\n (d) that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made;\\n (e) that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision;\\n (f) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision;\\n (g) that the decision was otherwise contrary to law. BACKGROUND \\n The applicant is the director, public officer and shareholder of the company Ivyside Pty Ltd (Ivyside). Ivyside claimed GST input tax credits with respect to various purchases in relation to the company. On 22 May 2007, the respondent advised the applicant that the claims at 'label G11' on his activity statement for the period July to September 2006 would be disallowed because valid tax invoices were not produced to substantiate the amount of GST credits claimed. The ATO subsequently issued the applicant notices pursuant to s 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA 1936) and s 353- 10 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA). On or around 3 October 2007, the ATO issued the applicant an amended assessment and penalties for the July to September quarter of 2006. COMPLAINT \\n In this matter, the complaint raised is as to the disallowance of the GST entitlements for the July-September quarter of 2006 'such entitlements being bona fide ones that should be allowed'. The applicant asserts that the decision of the respondent included 'purposeful mental and emotional pain and suffering the respondent is inflicting on the applicant; the applicant seeks relief from this harassment; oppression; and unlawful activities of the respondent'. However, in the affidavit in support of the application, the applicant clarifies that the decision of which he is seeking review was the decision by the respondent to deny and refuse him the right to an informal review of a GST issue relating to Ivyside. He stresses in his affidavit that it is not the original decision made by the respondent to disallow the GST entitlements but rather the decision to deny and refuse him an informal review. In support of that claim he annexes a document entitled 'Having your GST issue reviewed'. That document under the heading 'Informal Reviews' reads: \\n You can request an informal review of the GST decision we made or GST advice we provided, including private rulings. Generally, an informal review is conducted by an officer who is not involved in the original decision. We will advise you of the outcome of the review, which could include changing the decision or advice, or confirming it. If you'd like to request an informal review, you should contact the person handling your case or the office where the decision was made. The applicant also annexes a document apparently comprising a notification on behalf of Ivyside that it is seeking an order for review of the joint decision of the respondent and other officers of the ATO not to provide the company with an informal review of the audit which had been conducted. This communication was apparently sent by email on 2 January 2008. The applicant also annexes a much earlier letter from the ATO (23 August 1999) in which an apology is extended for distress and inconvenience which had been caused to the applicant and his wife in previous dealings. Assuming that the basis on which review is sought in this matter is a refusal to grant an informal review, the respondent complains that there is no evidence of a request for an informal review and there had been no agreement to conduct an informal review. More importantly, even if there had been such an agreement, a failure to do so would not constitute a decision as defined in s 3(1) and s 3(2) of the ADJR Act as no substantive rights would be affected by such a decision. The annexure appears to relate to refusal to provide an informal review of 'the audit ... conducted', again of which there is no evidence. APPROACH TO COMPETENCY CHALLENGE \\n The Court has jurisdiction to determine that it has no jurisdiction in respect of a proceeding instituted in the Court and to dismiss the proceeding accordingly ( Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33 ; (2000) 202 CLR 629 at [14] ). As observed in Mirvac Homes (NSW) Pty Limited v Airservices Australia (No 1) [2004] FCA 109 by Branson J, the provision in the Federal Court Rules for the filing and service of a notice of objection to competency is intended to encourage a respondent to inform the applicant promptly that the jurisdiction of the Court is in issue. The filing of a notice of objection to competency also places the Court on notice that its jurisdiction to make the orders sought by the applicant in the proceeding is challenged. The Court must then decide, before it makes the orders sought by the applicant or any substantive orders, whether it has jurisdiction to proceed ( R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190). In Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317 , Finkelstein J at [239] expressed the view that, where an issue which is properly characterised as jurisdictional is raised, it should be dealt with at the outset although a different approach was taken in Khatri v Price [1999] FCA 1289 ; (1999) 95 FCR 287 per Katz J at [14]). Whether or not it is necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issue at the outset, it appears to me that the current jurisdictional argument is succinct and independent in the sense that it can be resolved without any other evidentiary enquiry. If the argument is correct, there seems no obvious reason in this case why consideration of the jurisdictional challenge should be further deferred. Deferral has not been sought by the applicant. (As distinct from raising opposition to the objection). The applicant complains that for a period of 9 years between 1990 and 1999 the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) caused distress to him and his wife by failing to meet the requirements of the ATO Taxpayer's Charter. The applicant relied upon a written apology from the Commissioner dated 23 August 1999. That communication thanks the applicant for taking the time to contact the 'Problem Resolution Service' about legal action being taken against the applicant and his wife. It continues: \\n I am satisfied that the ATO failed to meet this requirement and I sincerely apologise for the distress and inconvenience this has caused you and your wife. Details relating to specific ATO officers have been referred to their manager for appropriate action. In addition, I have recommended the ATO procedures that brought about the legal action in your case be reviewed to ensure this type of problem does not occur again in the future. The applicant complains that had the respondent acted pursuant to the Taxpayers' Charter towards him and in accordance with the assurance given in the Commissioner's written apology that he would not be aggrieved by the oppressive actions of the respondent continuing to act in breach of the Charter and abusing his power. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \\n Section 5 of the ADJR Act relevantly provides as follows: \\n 5 Applications for review of decisions \\n\\n \\n (1) A person who is aggrieved by a decision to which this Act applies that is made after the commencement of this Act may apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court for an order of review in respect of the decision on any one or more of the following grounds: \\n\\n(a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision;\\n \\n(b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed;\\n \\n(c) that the person who purported to make the decision did not have jurisdiction to make the decision;\\n \\n(d) that the decision was not authorized by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made;\\n \\n(e) that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made;\\n \\n(f) that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision;\\n \\n(g) that the decision was induced or affected by fraud;\\n \\n(h) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision;\\n \\n(j) that the decision was otherwise contrary to law. (2) The reference in paragraph (1)(e) to an improper exercise of a power shall be construed as including a reference to: \\n\\n(a) taking an irrelevant consideration into account in the exercise of a power;\\n \\n(b) failing to take a relevant consideration into account in the exercise of a power;\\n \\n(c) an exercise of a power for a purpose other than a purpose for which the power is conferred;\\n \\n(d) an exercise of a discretionary power in bad faith;\\n \\n(e) an exercise of a personal discretionary power at the direction or behest of another person;\\n \\n(f) an exercise of a discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case;\\n \\n(g) an exercise of a power that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised the power;\\n \\n(h) an exercise of a power in such a way that the result of the exercise of the power is uncertain; and\\n \\n(j) any other exercise of a power in a way that constitutes abuse of the power. (3) The ground specified in paragraph (1)(h) shall not be taken to be made out unless: \\n\\n(a) the person who made the decision was required by law to reach that decision only if a particular matter was established, and there was no evidence or other material (including facts of which he or she was entitled to take notice) from which he or she could reasonably be satisfied that the matter was established; or\\n \\n(b) the person who made the decision based the decision on the existence of a particular fact, and that fact did not exist. Relevantly, s 3 of the ADJR Act identifies the decisions to which the Act applies as a 'decision of an administrative character made, proposed to be made, or required to be made (whether in the exercise of a discretion or not and whether before or after the commencement of this definition)': \\n (a) under an enactment referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of the definition of enactment; or\\n (b) by a Commonwealth authority or an officer of the Commonwealth under an enactment referred to in paragraph (ca) or (cb) of the definition of enactment; other than:\\n (c) a decision by the Governor-General; or\\n (d) a decision included in any of the classes of decisions set out in Schedule 1. By s 3(d) the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' is narrowed by the exclusion of decisions included in any of the class of decisions set out in Sch 1. Schedule 1 of the ADJR Act relevantly provides: \\n Schedule 1---Classes of decisions that are not decisions to which this Act applies \\n ...\\n (e) decisions making, or forming part of the process of making, or leading up to the making of, assessments or calculations of tax, charge or duty, or decisions disallowing objections to assessments or calculations of tax, charge or duty, or decisions amending, or refusing to amend, assessments or calculations of tax, charge or duty, under any of the following Acts: \\n\\n \\n A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 \\n \\n A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999 \\n \\n A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 \\n \\n Customs Act 1901 \\n \\n Customs Tariff Act 1995 \\n \\n Excise Act 1901 \\n \\n Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 \\n \\n Fuel Tax Act 2006 \\n \\n Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \\n \\n Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 \\n \\n Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 \\n \\n Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 \\n \\n Taxation Administration Act 1953 , but only so far as the\\n \\ndecisions are made under Part 3 - 10 in Schedule 1 to that Act\\n \\n Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 \\n \\n Trust Recoupment Tax Assessment Act 1985 ; \\n \\n \\n ... \\n\\n \\n Note: Subdivision B deals with the making, reduction and revocation of estimates of certain liabilities. (f) decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation under subsection 3E(1), 3G(1) or 3H(1) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; \\n\\n \\n (g) decisions under Part IV of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; \\n\\n \\n (ga) decisions under section 14ZY of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 disallowing objections to assessments or calculations of tax, charge or duty;\\n ... \\n CONTENTIONS \\n The Respondent\\n The respondent originally contended that the decision complained of by the applicant formed part of the process of making, or refusing to amend a calculation of tax under the GST Act. Therefore, the decision by the Commissioner to disallow GST input credits claimed by Ivyside would be excluded pursuant to Sch 1(e) of the ADJR Act. Accordingly the substituted ground of the alleged refusal to conduct an informal review would not be a 'decision' at all. The Applicant\\n The applicant asserts that the Court does have jurisdiction to hear the matter. He contends that the respondent's decision or conduct is reviewable in this Court and it falls within the class of decisions to which the ADJR Act applies. RELEVANT PRINCIPLES \\n Pursuant to s 8 of the ADJR Act, the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications made under the ADJR Act. Section 5 of the ADJR Act provides that a person aggrieved by a decision to which the Act applies may apply to the Court for an order of review on certain grounds. Section 6 of the ADJR Act provides for review of conduct, engaged in, being engaged in or proposed to be engaged in for the purpose of making a decision to which the ADJR Act applies. It is apparent from the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' in s 3 of the ADJR Act that the Act only applies where there is a making of, proposal to make or requirement to make a decision, the decision is of an administrative character, and the decision is made under an enactment. In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (at 335), Mason CJ discussed the meaning of 'decision' under s 3 of the ADJR Act and held (relevantly) (citations omitted): \\n (1) Meaning of \\\"Decision\\\" \\n\\n \\n The definition in s.3(1) does not elucidate significantly the meaning of the word \\\"decision\\\" as it is used in the A.D.(J.R.) Act. It is clear that a \\\"decision to which this Act applies\\\" must be a decision of an administrative character, that it may be made in the exercise of a discretion, and that it must be made under an enactment. But these characteristics provide little guidance as to the meaning of the word \\\"decision\\\" upon which the definition in s.3(1) is based. ... \\n\\n \\n Nonetheless other considerations point to the word having a relatively limited field of operation . First, the reference in the definition in s.3(1) to \\\"a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment\\\" indicates that a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorizes rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision. Secondly, the examples of decision listed in the extended definition contained in s.3(2) are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute or, in the words of Deane J., \\\"a determination effectively resolving an actual substantive issue \\\". Thirdly, s.3(3), in extending the concept of \\\"decision\\\" to include \\\"the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power\\\", to that extent qualifies the characteristic of finality. Such a provision would have been unnecessary had the Parliament intended that \\\"decision\\\" comprehend every decision, or every substantive decision, made in the course of reaching a conclusive determination. Finally, s.3(5) suggests that acts done preparatory to the making of a \\\"decision\\\" are not to be regarded as constituting \\\"decisions\\\" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of \\\"conduct\\\" as well as of a \\\"decision \\\". The relevant policy considerations are competing. On the one hand, the purposes of the A.D.(J.R.) Act are to allow persons aggrieved by the administrative decision-making processes of government a convenient and effective means of redress and to enhance those processes. On the other hand, in so far as the ambit of the concept of \\\"decision\\\" is extended, there is a greater risk that the efficient administration of government will be impaired. Although Bowen C.J. and Lockhart J. appeared to emphasize the first of these considerations in Australian National University v. Burns , there comes a point when the second must prevail, as their Honours implicitly acknowledged. To interpret \\\"decision\\\" in a way that would involve a departure from the quality of finality would lead to a fragmentation of the processes of administrative decision-making and set at risk the efficiency of the administrative process. ... \\n\\n \\n Another essential quality of a reviewable decision is that it be a substantive determination . With the exception of s.3(2)(g), the instances of decision mentioned in s.3(2) are all substantive in character. Moreover, the provisions in sub-ss. (1), (2), (3) and (5) of s.3 point to a substantive determination. In this context the reference in s.3(2)(g) to \\\"doing or refusing to do any other act or thing \\\" (emphasis added) should be read as referring to the exercise or refusal to exercise a substantive power. I do not perceive in s.16(1)(b) or in par. (e) of Sched.1 or par. (a) of Sched.2 to the A.D.(J.R.) Act any contrary implication. These exclusions from the A.D.(J.R.) Act or from s.13 appear to have been introduced for more abundant caution and it would be unwise to take too much from them. (emphasis added) \\n Despite the clarity of the passage from the learned Chief Justice, application of the principles has not been without difficulty. Views on whether or not particular decisions or conduct constitutes a reviewable decision have not always been unanimous (for example, Guss v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 88 ; (2006) 152 FCR 88). Not only are there questions as to whether conduct constitutes a decision but also whether it is a decision taken under an enactment. For a decision to be reviewable it must be one 'for which provision is made by or under a statute', the provision should be more specific than general (for example, Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxationn (1996) 65 FCR 269 and Electricity Supply Assn of Australia Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2001] FCA 1296 ; (2001) 113 FCR 230). A general authorisation for a body to act in a certain way is not usually regarded as being sufficient to qualify a decision as being one made under an enactment: Salerno v National Crime Authority (1997) 75 FCR 133. Dealing with the enactment aspect, the majority of the High Court in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 held (at [89]) that: \\n The determination of whether a decision is \\\"made ... under an enactment\\\" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment. A decision will only be \\\"made ... under an enactment\\\" if both these criteria are met. It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise. Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question. Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice. Indeed the High Court went on to observe that even though a decision taken may have a critical effect for the operation of the federal statute, if it is a decision made 'dehors' the federal statute, it would be un-reviewable. CONSIDERATION \\n In the present circumstances, although the decision of which complaint was originally made was carried out pursuant to statutory power, it does not constitute, in my view, a decision in the sense contemplated in s 3 of the ADJR Act or as explained by the Chief Justice in Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; 170 CLR 321. Nor does the alleged refusal to informally review. In the language of Fox ACJ in Evans v Friemann (1981) 35 ALR 428 at 431 the relevant decision or conduct did not constitute a decision which was final and conclusive for immediate purposes at least. It was not the ultimate or operative determination of an issue as distinct from the determination of issues arising in the course of making such an ultimate decision ( Social Services, Director-General of v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 31 ALR 571). The best guidance for this is the clear language of Mason CJ in Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; 170 CLR 321 that the decision will generally but not always entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense and a conclusion reached that is a step along the way in the course of reasoning leading to an ultimate decision would not ordinarily amount to a reviewable decision unless the statute provided for the making of a finding or ruling on that point so that the decision, though an indeterminate decision, might accurately be described as a decision under an enactment. When it comes to the consideration of policy, the competing policies on the one hand of permitting aggrieved persons to challenge administrative decisions and on the other, enabling efficient administration of government processes provides some guidance. If the legislation has provided other means of challenging decisions rather than judicial review under the ADJR Act, at least insofar as policy is concerned, availability of a right of challenge is not withheld. In Century Yuasa Batteries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 528 it was held that the Commissioner's decision to seek to recover an amount equal to withholding tax and penalty for late payment due by the applicant and the demand for payment of those sums was not reviewable because it did not constitute a substantive determination. This was because it lacked the necessary element of finality as liability for payment of those sums arose from the operation of the ITAA 1936 and not in consequence of any reviewable decision of the Commissioner. His Honour said (at 540-541): \\n Section 221YR(1) (the Commissioner's power to sue for the money as a debt due to the Commonwealth) and s 8 (the Commissioner's power of general administration of the ITAA) do not of themselves give force or effect to the decision to demand payment of a sum of money which the Commissioner claims is payable under the ITAA and as such it is not a decision made under an enactment ( Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 269 at 273 per Black CJ and at 278-279 per Spender J). Even if the view of Lockhart J in Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxation is adopted, namely that the power of the Commissioner to sue for the recovery of the amount due as a debt to the Commonwealth authorises the Commissioner to do all things reasonably necessary to recover the amount and thereby characterises the demand as a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment (at 276-277), that does not of itself make the demand a reviewable decision. The decision to seek to recover an amount equal to the withholding tax and penalty for late payment from the applicant, and the demand for payment of the same within 14 days, is not a substantive determination. It determines nothing. As such the decision lacks a necessary characteristic of a reviewable decision ( Bond at 337; Hutchins at 274, 277). Nor does the demand have any practical effect on the applicant. If the demand is not met by the applicant because of an erroneous view that it is not liable to make the payment, any liability for additional tax for late payment arises from the operation of the ITAA and not in consequence of any reviewable decision of the Commissioner. And as held in Ruddy v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 337 , the decision to sue for recovery was not a decision on an important substantive issue which was the essence of an ultimate decision which would have far-reaching consequences. It is not final or determinative because it does not remove a benefit or expose an applicant to detriment to which it is not already subject. Equally, Cooper J held in Golden City Car &amp; Truck Centre Pty Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 56 ALD 177 , a decision to commence proceedings for recovery of tax due under the ITAA 1936 is not a reviewable decision. See also Madera v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1616 ; (2004) 141 FCR 95 at [21] per Stone J (at [18]-[22]). In relation to the alternative ground advanced for the respondent, it is contended that what is sought is a review of the decision which formed part of the process of making or refusing to amend the calculation of tax under the GST Act and as such, it is a decision not capable of review under the ADJR Act being excluded by the provisions of Sch 1(e). The respondent contends that to the extent reliance is placed on the decision of the disallowance of claimed GST input credits, any decision taken in that regard (by the Commissioner rather than the respondent) would fall within the exclusion provisions due to the course of dealings between the parties) ( Bennett Honda Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1984] FCA 414 ; (1984) 4 FCR 99 per Morling J). The respondent stresses that Ivyside (as distinct from the applicant) has appellate procedures available to it in respect of the decision made by or on behalf of the Commissioner to disallow GST input tax credits claimed. It is for that reason that all components of the decisions by the officers of the ATO charged with making that decision are not susceptible to review under the ADJR Act as they fall within the parameters of par e to Sch 1. CONCLUSION \\n The original complaint was the purported infliction of pain on the applicant by disallowing GST entitlements. The revised complaint is as to the refusal of the internal review to discuss the issue. In my view, the alleged actions or conduct of which complaint has been raised by the applicant did not constitute a decision of a reviewable nature within the meaning of the ADJR Act and the authorities. There was no substantive determination. There was no decision having the character or quality of finality and the actions taken, even accepting for purposes that they had the quality asserted by the applicant, simply formed part of a process of leading up to the making of a decision by the Commissioner to disallow the claimed GST input credits claimed by Ivyside. It was not a decision which affected in any way or in any direct sense the applicant's legal rights and obligations. Further and as a distinct ground, even if there were an appropriate basis for review, it could be advanced only by the company, Ivyside not by the applicant. However, if this were the only issue standing in the way of the competency of this application, I may have granted any application to amend the identity of the applicant, or for that matter, the respondent. The difficulty with the competency of the application however, in my view, is much more fundamental, going to jurisdiction. The respondent's jurisdictional objection to competency must be upheld and the claim dismissed. The applicant is to pay the costs of the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.

Associate:\\n \\n \\nDated: 25 August 2009\\n \\n The Applicant represented himself.

On 4 September 2008, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) affirmed a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) of 23 November 2007. The SSAT found that the decision of the authorised review officer of Centrelink of 27 September 2007 to cancel Mr Zoia's Newstart allowance from 24 July 2007 was correct. The AAT affirmed that decision. In that hearing, Mr Zoia had sought an adjournment of his hearing on the basis that he did not want the AAT to make a decision in the matter but that he wanted the Minister for Centrelink to do so. The AAT declined that application for an adjournment on the basis that it had a duty to make a decision. The relevant issues before the AAT were: Section 605(2) and (3) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) (the SS Act) provides that the Secretary can require a person who has entered into a Newstart Activity Agreement to enter a new agreement by giving a person notice of the requirement and the place and time the agreement is to be negotiated. Such notices were sent to Mr Zoia. Mr Zoia acknowledged that in response he had attended at Centrelink offices several times but that he did not sign the Agreement despite a number of requests to do so. He was also warned of the consequences of failing to sign the Agreement but declined to do so. The AAT concluded that Mr Zoia by his own admissions made at the AAT acknowledged that he had no reasonable excuse pursuant to s 626 of the SS Act for not entering into the Newstart Activity Agreement. At the heart of Mr Zoia's appeal as best one can discern it is the argument that his Newstart allowance should not have been cancelled as there was no power to compel him to sign the new Newstart Activity Agreement. APPLICATIONS TO ADJOURN \\n Shortly prior to the hearing of this appeal on 5 August 2009, Mr Zoia wrote to the Western Australia District Registry of this Court requesting an opportunity to read the transcript of a hearing to which the reasons in Zoia v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 661 relate. On the occasion of that hearing (which was to be the hearing of the appeal) it had been necessary to adjourn the substantive hearing of the appeal in order to consider Mr Zoia's argument that the appeal was a nullity. While the discussion which ensued at that hearing could have no possible bearing on the substantive appeal, the starting time of the appeal was nevertheless deferred to permit Mr Zoia the opportunity to read the transcript. At the re-listed hearing of the appeal on 5 August 2009 Mr Zoia sought to re-agitate the issues dealt with in that interlocutory hearing. I did not permit that course. Mr Zoia sought a further adjournment of the hearing of the appeal on two grounds. The respondent opposed the application. The first ground was that he has sought access to a transcript of a directions hearing in which orders had been made pursuant to O 53 of the Federal Court Rules dealing with the procedural aspects of the appeal. In particular, he complained that he did not know what was involved in the settling of an appeal book index. To the extent that access to that transcript was required, it would inevitably have occasioned an adjournment because no transcript had been produced. I will assume that there is a recording in existence of that directions hearing which was conducted in October 2008. A further adjournment would not have been in the interests of justice. Mr Zoia apparently did not attend on the adjourned appointment for the settling of his appeal book index. I was informed by counsel for the respondent, and accept, that in light of his non-attendance, the respondent ensured that all of the material that had been before the AAT was made available in the appeal book for this hearing. In those circumstances, Mr Zoia was unable to identify and I was unable to discern any prejudice which would have been occasioned to him by proceeding with the hearing of the appeal. I also note, as submitted by counsel for the respondent, that Mr Zoia is no stranger to litigation and, in particular, has previously been involved in at least one appeal from the AAT and has some familiarity with the process. The second ground on which Mr Zoia sought an adjournment was in order to obtain legal advice. I accept Mr Zoia's argument that he is not well versed in the law. But I also concluded that the interests of justice did not support the granting of a further adjournment for the following grounds and I declined to permit it. Mr Zoia made a further application for legal assistance to the Attorney-General's Department which was rejected in March this year on the basis that the view was formed that his appeal did not appear to have sufficient prospects of success. As late as July this year following the adjournment of the first return date for the hearing of the appeal (too late in my opinion) he pursued a further application knowing, however, that the matter was listed for hearing on 5 August 2009. There is little reason to think that that late application would have met with success, that is to say, that the Attorney-General would have formed a contrary view to that expressed some months ago as to the prospects of success of the appeal. Steps were taken last year to endeavour to find a pro bono legal practitioner to advise Mr Zoia in relation to his appeal. Those steps were unsuccessful. As will be evident from the reasons which follow, the grounds of appeal on their face are barely intelligible and Mr Zoia's argument in support of them which has been raised at previous interlocutory hearings is equally lacking in clarity. On the other hand, Mr Zoia has raised similar points to those which he seemingly wishes to raise in this appeal in an appeal which is the subject of a decision by Siopis J in Zoia v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 988. Mr Zoia was self-represented and argued that appeal himself apparently with sufficient ability to at least convey to his Honour part of the nature of his complaint. His Honour having ruled against him on that complaint already, it is not particularly surprising that Mr Zoia's attempts to obtain legal assistance have not met with success. On the basis therefore of delay in bringing the oral application, or the repetition of earlier argument which had been rejected and that a reasonable opportunity had been given already to attempt to obtain legal representation, the request for a further adjournment for that purpose was declined. The appeal therefore proceeded. On a number of occasions in the course of argument on the appeal, Mr Zoia indicated that he would like leave to appeal to the High Court to ventilate both the need for legal counsel and certain constitutional arguments. I made it clear to Mr Zoia that if his appeal before me was unsuccessful, he would have the opportunity to appeal to the Full Federal Court and a further opportunity from there if he was unsuccessful again, to seek leave to appeal to the High Court. It was made clear to Mr Zoia that it was not within my power to grant him leave to appeal to the High Court. AN UNREPRESENTED LITIGANT \\n I have endeavoured to be mindful of special considerations applicable when a litigant is unrepresented ( Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 , Sahtout v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 16 at [42]; Rogers v Law Coast Mortgages Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 181). In Platcher v Joseph [2004] FCAFC 68 , the Full Court (at [104]-[106]) addressed the several authorities on this topic. In a civil case, the balance between affording assistance to an unrepresented party and not conferring an advantage on that party is to be observed. The degree of assistance necessary will vary according to the circumstances (at [105]). Consistently with the approach suggested by these authorities, the notice and grounds of appeal needed a deal of interpretation to be understood. The pursuit of that course has been attempted. THE APPEAL \\n For convenience, I again set out the notice of appeal, the orders sought and the grounds in support of the notice of appeal in this matter: \\n 1. TAKE NOTICE that the applicant appeals from the decision of \\n\\n \\nconstituted by Ms G Ettinger\\n \\n \\ngiven on 4 September 2008 at Perth\\n \\n \\nwhereby the Tribunal decided affirms the decision of the SSAT dated 23 November 2007\\n \\n \\n 2. THE QUESTIONS OF LAW raised on the appeal are \\n\\n \\n1. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The High Court Judgment --- Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead [1909] HCA 36 ; (1909) 8 CLR 330. Failed Justice. Failed Natural Justice. Failed Magna Carta, any charter guaranteeing liberty, any fundamental constitution or law guaranteeing rights. Failed Liberty, freedom to do as one please: power of free choice: privileges, rights, etc.\\n \\\"CATCHWORDS\\\", \\\"Applicant refused to sign new Agreement\\\", where is Peter Langley affidavit saying that. My Unemployment Benefits was cancel on Peter Langley information. I said to Peter, could you make the date after the hearing. Set the decision aside and substitute a new decision, that is despot justice, and also make them judge and jury. Set the decision aside, cancel, and substitute a new decision, that new decision can not be cancel. ARO, Brenda Parker can not correct a deception. Centrelink was trying to collect a debt from me. Constitution 64. can not be delegated. This month at Max Employment, I was told, a Lawyer can get it but I can't. About Peter Langley information or notes. 3. ORDERS SOUGHT \\n\\n My Unemployment Benefits to be fully restored plus compensation or ex gratia. Federal Court Rules --- Pro Bono Publico. The Hon Court to summon Peter Langley to give his information. Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to be changed to Minister, for Centrelink, under Constitution 64. 4. GROUNDS: \\n\\n \\n1. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The High Court Judgment --- Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead [1909] HCA 36 ; (1909) 8 CLR 330. 3. Magna Carta\\n \\n \\n4. Peter Langley information and notes. 5. Justice and Natural Justice. There is no obvious question of law disclosed in this notice of appeal filed. Although the notice and grounds of appeal together with the oral argument were difficult to comprehend, the main thrust of the complaint raised by Mr Zoia was that there was no power on the part of the respondent or anyone else to compel him to sign an agreement before paying him a Newstart allowance. This appears to be similar to one of the arguments that was advanced without success before Siopis J in Zoia [2008] FCA 988. There has been no appeal from that decision although Mr Zoia did contend before me that it was incorrect. The second aspect of the argument appears to be that, in fact, Mr Zoia had indicated that he was prepared to sign the agreement notwithstanding his primary position that he was not obliged to do so and that his willingness to sign the agreement was not taken into account. As to this argument, there was no evidence in support of this suggestion but, in any event, it could not constitute any reviewable error of law on the part of the AAT. There were subsidiary issues which I have also endeavoured to address. CONSTITUTIONAL POINTS \\n Although reference is made to the Constitution in the grounds of appeal in this matter, s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) does not apply in circumstances where the constitutional question is manifestly unarguable ( Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1151 ; (1999) 95 FCR 292 at 297 per French J and Daniels v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] SASC 431 at [17] - [19] ). That is so in this instance. RESTRICTION OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND PRIVILEGES \\n Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the notice of appeal appear to assert that personal freedoms and privileges guaranteed by the Magna Carta and the Constitution have been breached. There is no freedom 'to do as one please(s)' to be found in the Constitution . Nor is there a charter guaranteeing a subject's liberty. The High Court in Kruger v Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 held (at 61) (footnotes omitted): \\n In a number of recent cases it has been pointed out that the Australian Constitution , with few exceptions and in contrast with its American model, does not seek to establish personal liberty by placing restrictions upon the exercise of governmental power. Those who framed the Australian Constitution accepted the view that individual rights were on the whole best left to the protection of the common law and the supremacy of parliament. Thus the Constitution deals, almost without exception, with the structure and relationship of government rather than with individual rights. The fetters which are placed upon legislative action are, for the most part, for the purpose of distributing power between the federal government on the one hand and State governments on the other, rather than for the purpose of placing certain matters beyond the reach of any parliament. The Constitution does not contain a Bill of Rights . Indeed, the 1898 Constitutional Convention rejected a proposal to include an express guarantee of individual rights based largely upon the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and including a right to due process of law and the equal protection of laws. The framers preferred to place their faith in the democratic process for the protection of individual rights and saw constitutional guarantees as restricting that process . (emphasis added) \\n The Courts have previously considered the Commonwealth's power to impose conditions on the grant and payment of Newstart allowance. In Higgins v Commonwealth (1998) 79 FCR 528 , Finn J considered the scope of the power of the Commonwealth to provide unemployment benefits. His Honour said (at 532): \\n As a matter of characterisation, it is not open to serious argument that s 634 is a law with respect to the provision of unemployment benefits. The \\\"sufficiency of [s 634's] connection\\\" with the head of power - cf Leask v Commonwealth [1996] HCA 29 ; (1996) 140 ALR 1 at 33 - is incontrovertible. The power to provide such benefits must, I consider, include at its \\\"core\\\" ... powers (a) to stipulate qualifications for entitlement to, and for continuing entitlement to, unemployment benefits; and (b) to impose disqualifications (temporary or permanent) on entitlement to ... or continuing entitlement to ... unemployment benefits. Provided the criteria adopted do not otherwise offend a constitutional provision or limitation, the \\\"justice and wisdom\\\" of the criteria so selected are matters for the legislature not the courts ... (emphasis added) \\n A person does not have a right to receive a social security payment, benefit or allowance. The requirements prescribed by the SS Act are to be satisfied before such support is given. As found in Higgins 79 FCR 528 , it is within the Parliament's legislative power to impose conditions for the qualification and payability of social security payments. NATURAL JUSTICE \\n The applicant appears to claim he has been denied natural justice in relation to this matter. There is no support for that contention on the evidence. The applicant was afforded the opportunity to put material before the decision-maker as part of the internal review processes, to present his case to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and to present his case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT). The argument as to a lack of natural justice is rejected. DELEGATION OF DECISION-MAKING POWERS \\n The applicant also appears to assert that s 64 of the Constitution cannot be delegated. Section 64 of the Constitution provides as follows: \\n 64 Ministers of State \\n\\n \\nThe Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish. Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive Council, and shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth. Ministers to sit in Parliament \\n \\n \\nAfter the first general election no Minister of State shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. As best it can be understood, the applicant's argument appears to be that only the relevant Minister can make a valid decision to cancel a person's Newstart allowance under the SS Act. This argument is incorrect. One of the functions of a Minister of State of the Commonwealth as specified in s 64 of the Constitution is to administer such departments of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish. From time to time administrative arrangement orders (AAO) are issued to specify matters for which a department is responsible, namely: \\n (a) the matters referred to in the Part of the Schedule relating to that Department; and\\n (b) matters arising under the legislation administered by a Minister of State administering the Department. (emphasis added) \\n The following table sets out the department which was responsible for 'matters arising' under the SS Act with respect to Newstart allowance at the time of various key events in relation to these proceedings: Date Event AAO in Force Responsible Department 07/08/2007 Applicant's Newstart allowance cancelled AAO issued on 21/09/2006, covering the period 30/01/2007 to 21/12/2007 Department of Employment and Workplace Relations 27/09/2007 Authorised review officer reviewed and affirmed the cancellation decision AAO issued on 29/09/2006, covering the period 30/01/2007 to 21/12/2007 Department of Employment and Workplace Relations 23/11/2007 Social Security Appeals Tribunal reviewed and affirmed the cancellation decision AAO issued on 21/09/2006, covering the period 31/01/2007 to 21/12/2007 Department of Employment and Workplace Relations 10/12/2007 Application filed with the AAT AAO issued on 03/12/2007, covering the period 03/12/2007 to 24/01/2008 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations 04/09/2008 AAT's decision issued AAO issued on 25/01/2008 (as amended on 01/05/2008), which commenced on 25/01/2008 and which continues in force Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations 24/09/2008 Notice of Appeal filed AAO issued on 25/01/2008 (as amended on 01/05/2008), which commenced on 25/01/2008 and continues in force Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations DELEGATION OF DECISION-MAKING/REVIEW POWERS TO OFFICERS AND AAT \\n Paragraphs 8-10 of the notice of appeal appear to assert that the power to make a decision as to the qualification of a person for the Newstart allowance cannot be delegated. This is not correct. The broad power of delegation granted to the Secretary in s 234 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 makes this clear. See also s 126(3) and s 149 of that Act and s 43(1) of the AAT Act which permits review of decisions made under the social security law and to affirm, vary, set aside, substitute a new decision or remit the matter to the Secretary for reconsideration. INTELLIGIBILITY OF NOTICE OF APPEAL \\n Although the Court and the respondent have endeavoured to interpret what it is that Mr Zoia was seeking to contend in his notice of appeal, shortly put, most of the notice of appeal is almost unintelligible. Mr Zoia is a reasonably frequent litigant in this Court and may recall the decision of French J (as his Honour then was) in Zoia v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] FCA 863 where his Honour said (at [5]): \\n On the face of the notice of appeal there is no intelligible appeal or matter put before the Court. In my opinion the notice of appeal should be struck out without any further delay and the application dismissed. The time of the Court and of the respondent is not to be taken up by responding to matters which do not contain any intelligible basis upon which the dispute or matter in question can be identified.

In effect, it seeks to restrain the defendants from promoting, establishing or carrying on the business of any managed investment scheme that requires registration but which has not been registered. From September 2005 until October 2005 the Defendants contravened section 601ED(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 by operating an unregistered managed investment scheme defined in the Schedule to the Order ('the Scheme') which required registration as a managed investment scheme but was not so registered. The proceeding seeks relief in respect of an unregistered managed investment scheme known as \\\"FullTank\\\" (\\\"the Scheme\\\"). FULLTANK WAS AN UNREGISTERED MANAGED INVESTMENT SCHEME \\n \\n27 Relevantly, s 9 of the Act defines a managed investment scheme as a scheme that has the following features:\\n \\n \\\"(i) people contribute money or money's worth as consideration to acquire rights (interests) to benefits produced by the scheme (whether the rights are actual, prospective or contingent and whether they are enforceable or not); \\n (ii) any of the contributions are to be pooled, or used in a common enterprise, to produce financial benefits, or benefits consisting of rights or interests in property, for the people (the members) who hold interests in the scheme (whether as contributors to the scheme or as people who have acquired interests from holders); \\n (iii) the members do not have day-to-day control over the operation of the scheme (whether or not they have the right to be consulted or to give directions)\\\".\",\n          \"INTRODUCTION \\n The applicant seeks review of the respondent's decision under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (ADJR Act). STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \\n Section 5 of the ADJR Act relevantly provides as follows: \\n 5 Applications for review of decisions \\n\\n \\n (1) A person who is aggrieved by a decision to which this Act applies that is made after the commencement of this Act may apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court for an order of review in respect of the decision on any one or more of the following grounds: \\n\\n(a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision;\\n \\n(b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed;\\n \\n(c) that the person who purported to make the decision did not have jurisdiction to make the decision;\\n \\n(d) that the decision was not authorized by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made;\\n \\n(e) that the making of the decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made;\\n \\n(f) that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision;\\n \\n(g) that the decision was induced or affected by fraud;\\n \\n(h) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision;\\n \\n(j) that the decision was otherwise contrary to law.
